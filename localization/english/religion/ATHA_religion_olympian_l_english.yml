This usually manifested in lavish honours awarded to the Kings, their relatives and their friends. In one instance, King Antigonus Monophthalmus and his son Demetrius were each recognised as a 'Sōtēr' or Saviour and were honoured with a festival and altar following their liberation of Athens.\n\nThe influence of Soterism was much more profound in the eastern Greek realms than in the mainland or the western colonies. Influenced by Persian and Egyptian traditions, Seleukid and Ptolemaic kings supported the proliferation of ruler cults within their realms and appointed relatives or favourites as priests within these cults.#!"

While not as famous as its [Concept('flavor_oracle_of_delphi','Delphic')|E] counterpart, it nevertheless served as a religious capital for the Epirotes and attracted numerous pilgrims who wished to glean wisdom from the leaves rustling in the great oak.\n\nAlthough much of Epirus would become urbanised by the 3rd century BC, the region retained a distinctly pastoral identity as rural cults continued to be celebrated in the cities. Whereas the archaic mother goddess Dione was relegated to a mere aspect of Hera elsewhere in Greece, she continued to be worshipped at Dodona along with Zeus Naios.#!"

It was perhaps best known in antiquity as the domain of the nature-god Pan, though it also possessed important cult centres to Zeus Lykaios and Despoina.\n\nOn account of the region's natural features, Arcadian religious practices and myths developed a unique pastoral bent as well as some more intriguing features, such as the alleged lycanthropy and cannibalism taking place high on Mount Lykaion..."

 cretan_faith_adherent_plural:0 "Kretagenists"
 cretan_faith_desc:0 "Believing that the gods were once mere mortals, the Kretagenists hold dear a worldview that is considered unusual, controversial even, by fellow worshippers of the Olympian pantheon.\n\n#weak The Cretan theogeny stood out in its time for stating that the gods were born mortal but ascended to godhood on account of their contributions to humankind. Such a perspective earned the ire of other Greeks, who viewed the Cretans as atheists and accused them, perhaps erroneously, of having a tomb to Zeus.\n\nIn any case, Crete played a prominent role in Greek mythology, being the birth-place and home of various gods and heroes. The island was also known for its mystery rites, which were handed down publicly in contrast with similar cults found elsewhere."
