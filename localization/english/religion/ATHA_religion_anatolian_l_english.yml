 angdistianism_faith_desc:0 "Under influence by Hellenism, the Phrygians adopted many new gods in addition to continuing to worship their traditional gods.\n\n#weak The influence of Hellenism, heightened since Alexander’s conquests, was felt across the east; no less so in Phrygia. The Great Mother, previously depicted standing in shrines and facades, started to be depicted sitting on a throne surrounded by lions. She also was increasingly addressed by the Greek titles of Meter and Angdistis.\n\nDuring this period, the sanctuary at Pessinous became very significant in the region. It attracted the attention of the Attalid kings of Pergamon, who built a temple there. There was a black stone here, important to the cult of the Mother, that was taken to Rome when the Romans decided to adopt the cult of Cybele.\n\nDuring the Hellenistic period, the first evidence for different deities starts emerging in Phrygia. Hosios and Dikaios (Pious and Just) start being worshipped; Meter receives epithets like Dindymene and Sozon, a rider god, is attested in coinage and inscriptions.#!"

 kubeleyism_faith_desc:0 "Continuing their rites and traditions from ages past, Kubeleyists carve shrines into the mountains to worship their Great Mother and other deities.\n\n#weak Their Phrygian Kubeleyist religion has been reconstructed from archeological evidence and speculation based on the subsequent Greco-Roman cult. The Phrygians are thought to have worshipped a variety of deities including Sabazios, Hosios and Dikaios; however their most well-known goddess is Matar Kubeliya, who is a mother goddess who would later make her way into the cults of the Greco-Roman world as Cybele. Her shrines, depicting her inside the doorframe of a house or building holding various (fantastical) animals, imply that she was seen as a guardian of the household and domineering over nature.\n\nLittle is known about the rites and worship of this religion. It seems that the priesthood to the mother goddess was castrated: this is often reported by historical writers about the priests of the Greco-Roman Cybele cult. Evidence that this may also have been practiced in Phrygia is given by a silver statuette of a beardless praying man. As the beard was a sign of maturity in eastern art, this statuette may depict a eunuch priest.#!"
