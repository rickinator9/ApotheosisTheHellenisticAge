Those seeking counsel with the Oracle would not be given access to her easily however: following the journey to the sanctuary, supplicants would be vetted by the priests of Apollo and ritually prepared for entry into the temple. The Oracle's prophecies could sometimes be interpreted in multiple ways. When Croesus of Lydia asked whether he would defeat Persia in a war, the Oracle stated that he would destroy a mighty empire. Yet when Croesus marched to war, it would not be Persia that fell but his own realm.\n\nThe temples of Apollo at Delphi and Demeter near Thermopylae were protected and maintained by the Amphictyonic League, a coalition of states representing various tribes, or #EMP éthnē#!, of the Greeks. Over time, some in the league attempted expand their power by applying legislative pressure on other members. This politicising of the league would backfire in 356 BC when it caused the 3rd Sacred War. Being waged for 10 years, this conflict pitted members against each other, saw Delphi plundered to fund mercenaries and created the opening that led to Macedonia gaining their hegemony over Greece.#!"
