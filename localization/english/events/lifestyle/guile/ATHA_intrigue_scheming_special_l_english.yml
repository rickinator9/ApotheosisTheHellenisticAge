 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1001.t:0 "A Dangerous Dinner"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1001.desc:0 "It is another dull dinner attended by my courtiers and guests. Everything from the conversation to the meal simply fails to spark any interest for me whatsoever. Noticing my untouched final course of dinner, [taste_tester.GetTitledFirstName] makes [taste_tester.GetHerHis] way over and offers to finish it on my behalf. Without giving it much thought, I pass it along and return to the task of finding anything interesting about tonight’s events. Not even an hour later, [taste_tester.GetTitledFirstName] is found retching in the corner. In a brief moment of peace [taste_tester.GetSheHe] are able to simply mutter “it was the food”. Turning about the room, I notice no one else appears to be sick before it dawns on me. Was my dish poisoned?"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1001.a:0 "The spymaster must investigate."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1001.b:0 "Surely it was just a coincidence."

 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1002.t:0 "A Dance with Death"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1002.desc:0 "[council_member.GetTitledFirstName] pulls me aside one night and says “I have finished investigating what happened at dinner.” “It appears that your dish was not poisoned. Instead, [taste_tester.GetTitledFirstName] forgot that [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HealthGodName|U] has afflicted them with an intolerance for the contents of that particular meal”.\n\nThis time may not have been a threat on my life, but what of the next time? Perhaps it is time I begin studying and building an immunity to poisons. But where should I begin this very dangerous task?"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1002.a:0 "Hemlock would be sensible."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1002.b:0 "Mandrake is a common poison."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1002.c:0 "Everyone knows of nightshade."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1002.d:0 "No way, this is a slippery slope to trouble."
 poison_warning_label.tt:0 "@warning_icon! Ingesting poison is inherently dangerous! But there may be a rewarding payoff in the end..."

 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1003.critical_success:0 "Effective application of poison"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1003.desc.critical_success:0 "You have learned a great deal about identifying common poisons. In addition, after creating and applying a careful regimen of the select poison, you have felt no adverse effects at all."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1003.success:0 "Fine application of poison"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1003.desc.success:0 "After taking several small doses of the deadly poison, you feel no adverse effects and have learned more about poisons in general."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1003.failure:0 "Poor application of poison"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special_1003_desc_failure:0 "Despite your best efforts, you seem to have taken too much poison and are suffering ill effects from it."

 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1004.t:0 "The Second Song"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1004.desc_hemlock_failure:0 "I try in vain to steady my trembling hands by feebly clutching my burning stomach. My heart is racing, drool falls unabated from my lips, and my whole body aches from the poison hemlock running rampant through my veins. It appears I miscalculated the dosage and have taken a dangerous amount of the plant. With any luck I will recover in time."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1004.desc_mandrake_failure:0 "The world swirls around me as I attempt to lick my cracked, dry lips. Clutching my painful stomach, I empty out its contents before slumping down to the ground. I close my eyes to try to make the world stop spinning. How much mandrake did I eat? It must have been too much. With any luck, the effects will go away soon enough."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1004.desc_nightshade_failure:0 "As though a drummer was marching to war in head, the incessant pounding makes it impossible to think straight. I croach out a request for more water from one of my servants. Though I know it is nearly time to take another dosage, the thought of eating anymore of that poisonous nightshade makes me want to resume vomiting. May [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HealthGodName] show me mercy and take this affliction from me."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1004.desc:0 "\n\nI have survived thus far into my journey to unlock a deeper understanding of the poisons of the world. I should select my next focus in order to continue my work, or perhaps it is time that I stop this very dangerous endeavor…"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1004.a:0 "Datura shall be my next focus."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1004.b:0 "Aconite is famed for its lethality."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1004.c:0 "Henbane is as dangerous as they come."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1004.d:0 "I shouldn't take any more risk."

 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1005.desc.critical_success:0 "You continue to greatly enhance your knowledge of the common poisons of the world without acquiring any negative effects."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1005.desc.success:0 "You have survived another round of testing with poisons, learned from the experience, and avoided the worst of the side effects."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1005.desc.failure:0 "You are unable to avoid the risks that come with continuing to ingest deadly poisons and are suffering their ill effects."

 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1006.t:0 "The Last Dance"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1006.desc_datura_failure:0 "I lean against the wall, trying to orient myself in the room that seems to be spinning around me. I rub my dry, itchy arms before noticing that they are covered in blotches of a red rash. The rash seems to move, taking unnatural shapes as though it were alive. I shake my head to clear my mind. This can’t be right, it must just be the effects of the datura. Suddenly, my heart begins to pound inside my chest as though I had just sprinted across the continent. I decide to lie down and rest, and hopefully recover quickly from the poisoning."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1006.desc_aconite_failure:0 "With a great deal of effort, I lift my weary arm up and pinch first my other arm and then my legs. Nothing, I don’t feel the pinches at all. My arm flops down back beside me as I try to focus on anything but the nausea I feel. So this is what aconite poisoning feels like? I’ll have to remember this for when I can return to my studies."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1006.desc_henbane_failure:0 "After having spent the last several hours expunging my body of everything, I lie exhausted in bed with a pounding headache. I wipe away the drool slowly gliding its way down my chin. To think that some seemingly innocuous plant like henbane would bring me so low. This will certainly be a lesson learned."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1006.desc:0 "\n\nHaving survived another round of testing lethal poisons, it is time to consider which poison I will focus on for my final efforts. This will certainly be the most dangerous round as my body has undoubtedly undertaken a great deal of strain from the previous poisonous doses. Which poison should I choose, or do I stop here before this goes too far?"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1006.a:0 "Hellebore will be the last."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1006.b:0 "I shall finish with Colchium."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1006.c:0 "I can learn much from the Yew."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1006.d:0 "Opium can be quite potent."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1006.e:0 "This has gone far enough."

 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1008.t:0 "A Successful Conclusion"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1008.desc_hellebore_failure:0 "No matter how many times I wash out my mouth since eating the hellebore, I cannot get the insistent burning to stop. The pain in my stomach is even worse. It feels as though my stomach were trying to leap out of my body to escape the effects of the poison. Is that possible? Is this poison going to kill me?! I am suddenly so anxious about what is happening to me."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1008.desc_colchium_failure:0 "My servants have carried me back to my bed where I am now resting. I was simply too weak to move myself after being forced to empty the contents of my stomach. This colchium has really done some damage. I should have been more careful, but should only think about the future now."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1008.desc_yew_extract_failure:0 "One minute my heart is racing and the next it feels barely there at all. Perhaps, I should have taken an axe to that yew rather than eating it. I certainly would have saved myself the trouble of revisiting my last meal. And by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WaterGodName|U], my mouth is so dry. It is as if I have been sucking on sand for half a day."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1008.desc_opium_failure:0 "Despite having emptied out my stomach on several occasions, I continue to feel this insatiable hunger. It began not long after I took a particularly large dose of opium. In addition, I have begun to see all manner of indescribable shapes and colors. If I didn’t feel so awful between the vomiting, chills, anxiety, and dizziness, I would almost see this was an enjoyable experience."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1008.desc:0 "\n\nThis gauntlet of deadly poisons is finally over and I have emerged from the other side a changed person. I know a great deal more about these lethal concoctions, both how to make them and how to counteract them. It remains to be seen how I will choose to use this new found knowledge."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1008.a:0 "I am a master of poisons now."

 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1009.t:0 "A Poison Too Far"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1009.desc_nightshade_critical_failure:0 "Titling between exhaustion and terror, I lie rooted to my bed, unable to move. From the shadows emerge a host of disturbing beasts with unnatural human and animal qualities. They begin to dance around me, intermittently chanting and jeering as they ridicule my hubris for thinking I could conquer the deadly nightshade. To my horror, [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DeathDeityName] emerges from the mod of a monster to personally tear my life away from me."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1009.desc_mandrake_critical_failure:0 "I have lost track of how much time I have spent bedridden since the symptoms of the mandrake poisoning began to take effect. My body, having been unable to keep anything down, feels stretched thin. My mouth is so dry that I am unable to produce any words as I call out for help from anyone near me. Utterly defeated, I close my eyes and breathe my last weak breath."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1009.desc_hemlock_critical_failure:0 "I am such a fool for ingesting so much hemlock at once. Despite the unbearable pain wracking my body, I am unable to move a muscle as I lie staring up at the ceiling. By now every breath feels like I am lifting a mountain off my chest. But after so much agony, I mercifully lose consciousness before losing the ability to breath all together."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1009.desc_henbane_critical_failure:0 "Beating as hard and deep as a horde of cavalry charging in circles around my chest, my heart pounds furiously inside me. Helpless, I can feel another episode about to fall upon me. In a rush, my mind goes blank as all the muscles in my body begin to constrict in a chaotic mess. I writhe in my bed for several moments before the episode passes. This is it, my body simply has no more to give and the henbane finally takes my life."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1009.desc_datura_critical_failure:0 "I keep my eyes closed, anything to stop the world from swirling around me. Besides, if I keep my eyes closed I don’t have to see the grotesque shapes that dance in the shadows of my room anymore. Fever chills wrack my exhausted body, which feels uncomfortable all over, as though I wasn’t even wearing my own skin anymore. I want to sleep, to make all these sensations go away. Yes, to sleep for a very long time, in fields of beautiful datura, that would be lovely…"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1009.desc_aconite_critical_failure:0 "This flower, aconite, the step mother’s poison, is going to kill me. I can feel the intense pounding of my blood crash through my body with every beat, as though [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WaterGodName] had created a seastorm inside me. And the pain, pain like I’ve never felt before radiates through both my chest and my stomach. I don’t think my heart can continue to pound so furiously for much longer…"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1009.desc_hellebore_critical_failure:0 "Ever since I ate the hellebore, I had found no peace in mind or in body. My mind has been racing, leaping from one fear to another to suddenly accepting that nothing matters in this life anymore. My body, while in excruciating pain, has not been able to retain any food or drink the servants have given me. But today, it feels different. My mind is finally beginning to rest and the pain is beginning to subside. Yes, it’s all beginning to just drift away…"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1009.desc_colchium_critical_failure:0 "My servants tell me that I have lost quite a lot of blood as my body tries to cleanse itself of the poisonous colchium. I have been drifting in and out of consciousness ever since the seizures began too. I feel so frail at this point that the next one might simply finish me off. Oh no, I think I feel another one coming…"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1009.desc_yew_extract_critical_failure:0 "I was lucky to have made it back to my bed before collapsing from the dizziness. My body has felt so weak since I ate the poison that I extracted from the yew. I am surprised I have even made it this far.What’s this? My heart has just started to pound ferociously in my chest. It hurts so much, as if I had breathed in molten metal. Make it stop. Please, make it stop!..."
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1009.desc_opium_critical_failure:0 "What a disturbing sight. A pink froth flowed out of my mouth as it convulsed wildly on the bed, flinging the accumulated sweat in all directions. Not only my lips, but my fingers too, had turned a faded blue color while my eyes seemed to roll back into my head. Then suddenly my body stopped and went limp. And to think, all of this was caused by a little opium. Wait. How am I seeing this grotesque scene from outside my body?"
 ATHA_intrigue_scheming_special.1009.a:0 "I can conclude that the poison is quite deadly."
