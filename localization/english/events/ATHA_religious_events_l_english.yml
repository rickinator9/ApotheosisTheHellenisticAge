  ATHA_religious.0001.desc:0 "Now that I have chosen to build a tomb, my advisors are up in a hurry to advise worthy locations for my tomb. One advisor suggests to build in a secluded area with little human habitation, so as to limit the chance of looting. Another proposes to build it right outside town, to give the inhabitants an eternal display of my power.\nRegardless of their merit, it will be my choice that matters. The court is awaiting my decision for a location for my home in the next life."
