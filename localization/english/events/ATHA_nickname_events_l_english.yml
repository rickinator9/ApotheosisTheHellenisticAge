  ATHA_nickname.0100.desc:0 "A King like me often has to take tours through their realm to assert [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] authority throughout the land. As I was entering a village in [nickname_county.GetNameNoTier], a small [nickname_county.GetProvince.GetCounty.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] boy pointed at me: "Is that the bastard king, mother?". The mother was too late in hushing her son to prevent the insult from being spoken and she took her son by the arm and fled to the safety of the village.\n\nAfter sending out scouting parties, I was surprised to hear that not only this village used [ROOT.Char.Custom('NicknameTheBastard')] to refer to me, but the wider region! Who do those peasants think they are to speak of my illegitimacy?!"

I have heard that some villages in [nickname_county.GetNameNoTier] have been calling you [ROOT.Char.Custom('NicknameTheClubfooted')], a most rude moniker to refer to... your feet. What do you say, my liege?""

  ATHA_nickname.0122.desc:0 "Perhaps they had noticed the daily shipments of food to the [ROOT.Char.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')] or possibly one of them had seen my physique: regardless of cause the inhabitants of [nickname_barony.GetNameNoTier] have started referring to me as [ROOT.Char.Custom('NicknameTheFat')]. There is certainly some truth in it; I have greatly enjoyed eating the great food the cooks put on my table, but this is no way to address their [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName]!"
