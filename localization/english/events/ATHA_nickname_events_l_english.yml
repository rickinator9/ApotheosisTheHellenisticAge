  ATHA_nickname.0100.desc:0 "A King like me often has to take tours through their realm to assert [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] authority throughout the land. As I was entering a village in [nickname_county.GetNameNoTier], a small [nickname_county.GetProvince.GetCounty.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] boy pointed at me: "Is that the bastard king, mother?". The mother was too late in hushing her son to prevent the insult from being spoken and she took her son by the arm and fled to the safety of the village.\n\nAfter sending out scouting parties, I was surprised to hear that not only this village used [ROOT.Char.Custom('NicknameTheBastard')] to refer to me, but the wider region! Who do those peasants think they are to speak of my illegitimacy?!"
  ATHA_nickname.0100.a:0 "It's true, I guess..."
  ATHA_nickname.0100.b:0 "Silence them with bribes."

I have heard that some villages in [nickname_county.GetNameNoTier] have been calling you [ROOT.Char.Custom('NicknameTheClubfooted')], a most rude moniker to refer to... your feet. What do you say, my liege?""
  ATHA_nickname.0101.a:0 "These damn feet! Why can't they be like everybody else's?!"

I was surprised, however, to find a crowd of carefully dressed [ROOT.Char.Custom('OppositeWomenMen')] outside of [nickname_vassal.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]'s [nickname_vassal.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')]. One of the men in my entourage explained the situation:\n"My liege, it seems your reputation has preceded you. We have received reports that peasants and highborn nobles alike refer to you as '[ROOT.Char.Custom('NicknameTheFair')]', affectionately referring to your attractive appearance. It seems that, as soon as you heard you were headed this way, these [ROOT.Char.Custom('OppositeWomenMen')] came to see you for themselves.""

The death of the young [nick_the_young_receiver.GetTitleTierName] caught everyone by surprise. It reminded many of the fickle nature of life: how life could so quickly be taken away.\n\nSoon after [nick_the_young_receiver.GetHerHis] early death, some in the court and beyond started referring to [nick_the_young_receiver.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] as 'the Young'. Within a few weeks, [nick_the_young_receiver.GetSheHe] was referred to as [nick_the_young_receiver.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] '[ROOT.Char.Custom('NicknameTheYoung')]'."

The anger of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetPantheonTerm], the impiety that had to be cleansed of my body and the punishment I gave myself. I could not control it: the gods demanded penance. And so I cut out my eye. No matter the pain, no matter the consequences, the gods will have their will done.\n\nEver since, my court does not dare look upon my face without wearing an eyepatch. Some murmurs have referred to me as [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] '[ROOT.Char.Custom('NicknameTheOneEyed')]', 'the One-Eyed'. That is certainly an accurate descriptor."
  ATHA_nickname.0108.desc:0 "I remember it like the day of yesterday. The man standing in front of me, spear in hand while I held onto my own. We danced around each other, both trying to injure our opponent while avoiding the opposite side's blows. I remember the sudden sting like the day of yesterday. The pain overwelmed me so much I was unaware of the spear that now impaled my eye. However, my opponent was the first to fall as he clasped his bleeding throat. My spear had struck true.\n\nEver since that day, my court does not dare look upon my face without wearing an eyepatch. Some murmurs have referred to me as [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] '[ROOT.Char.Custom('NicknameTheOneEyed')]', 'the One-Eyed'. That is certainly an accurate descriptor."

  ATHA_nickname.0116.desc:0 "While my personality is known for many characteristics, my bravery trumps all my other personality traits. In battle, I lead from the fore and accompany my men into the melee. I relish the blood flying in the air, the battle cries and the glories of victory. Duels are not an uncommon sight in my court, as I do not often deny a challenge. Indeed, I face challenges head-first in social and administrative life as well.\n\nSome in the court, recognizing my bravery but also fearing my impatience and recklessness, have started calling me '[ROOT.Char.Custom('NicknameTheBold')]' in reference of my bold behavior. My advisors suggest that I should stop with recklessly involving myself in battles to stop my reputation from spreading and to perhaps, save my life."

  ATHA_nickname.0121.desc_good:0 "Word has spread internationally about my court ceremonies and accommodations, particularly our diet.

Although foreigners may condemn our divine rights, my people know that [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetHighGodName] commands us to gorge ourselves on our fellow man.\n\nInternationally, I am now known as [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] '[ROOT.Char.Custom('NicknameTheDevourer')]'. They believe that by giving me such a nickname as 'the Devourer', they can belittle me."
  ATHA_nickname.0121.desc_bad:0 "An air of fear hangs over my court. None of my courtiers enter the corridors on their own: they always gather in groups to face the dark corridors. It is not the dark they fear, however. It is the new 'diet' some courtiers as well as myself have adopted. Ordinary townsfolk, kitchenhands, nobles and courtiers have disappeared, only for strange meat to be served up a few days later.\n\nFew have failed to make the obvious connection. Within my realm and without, people whisper about the Man-Eating [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName] [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] '[ROOT.Char.Custom('NicknameTheDevourer')]'."

While I was just about to reject yet another invitation to a social outing, [nickname_councillor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] quickly got to the point: the play was about me!\nThe play is about an avid poet named [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] who unwittingly writes the most terrible poetry the world has ever seen. Poetic circles eagerly await each of his new works to amuse themselves with horrific examples of prose, his lovers stock the latrines with his numerous messages and his court barely manages to stay awake during another one of his recitals of a poem.\n\nMany of my fellow rulers have ironically come to refer to me as [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] '[ROOT.Char.Custom('NicknameThePoet')]' as public knowledge of the play has become known."

Each new poem grabbed ever more attention.\n\nToday recitations of my poems are held daily, drawing eager audiences each time.
