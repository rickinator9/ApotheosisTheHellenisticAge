  city_state_emergency.0001.desc:0 "'The tip is blunt and rusty. With this spear you will disappoint our city in battle' I said as I was inspecting the men. As marshal I always meet with small groups of citizens to check our war readiness. By the end of the afternoon, I noticed a ruckus at a nearby inn and walked over to see what was happening. I saw a group of mercenaries whom we recently hired to aid in our wars. One [mutiny_ringleader.GetWomanMan] stood out among the group: [mutiny_ringleader.GetFirstName]. [mutiny_ringleader.GetSheHe|U] is a captain among one of the mercenary companies. I stayed out of sight and listened carefully...\n\nThe mercenaries loudly complained about their delayed wages and the lack of combat; combat that would have allowed them to pillage enemy settlements. The sound levels and redness in their faces quickly escalated as they voiced all of their grievances. All the while [mutiny_ringleader.GetFirstName] silently listened. Finally [mutiny_ringleader.GetSheHe] spoke up: 'It is as clear to me as it is to all of you that [ROOT.Char.GetLiege.GetTitledFirstName] has breached our contract by forsaking our wages. Worry not, men, I have heard your worries among many of the other men. I just have to talk to a few other comrades and we will give [ROOT.Char.GetLiege.GetFirstName] the treatment he deserves.'"

As such, I saw an opportunity to take from the temple treasury to give to [ROOT.Char.GetLiege.GetTitledFirstName]. The treasury of the temple is vast, filled with sacrifices and donations since time immemorial. Much of the treasure had been filed and organised so that missing treasure would surely be noticed by other priests and temple servants. That is why I looked at the piles of unorganised treasure, mostly made up of trinkets and non-monetary goods. A gold necklace studded with wonderful blue stones instantly caught my eyes.\n\nAs I was on my way to [ROOT.Char.GetLiege.GetFirstName]'s residence while carrying the necklace and a few other trinkets, I was pushed to the floor from behind. My assailant brutally attacked and punched me before he was removed by the mob. \"That's my wife's.

A citizen recognised the necklace and attacked [court_chaplain.GetHerHim] in the streets outside my residence! [court_chaplain.GetFirstName] came to me immediately afterward.\n\nThis citizen is certainly already spreading the word on our necessary appropriation of temple treasure and soon my political opponents will hear.

  city_state_emergency.0013.desc:0 "The man left as fast as he arrived. He brought in a shining bronze armour, well-maintained and forged in the classic fashion. The helmet covered the entire face, leaving small openings for the eyes, nose and mouth. The muscled cuirass intimidated the enemy with the warrior's strength and prowess. Equipment of this kind was worn since time immemorial, but has become a rarity on the battlefield since the introduction of lighter equipment.\n\nLike most expensive equipment, this armour had passed in the man's family from father to son for centuries. It was a surprise to me that the man would donate such a wonderful family heirloom to our temple; he had apparently grown weary of 'war and slaughter' and sought to make it unlikely for any of his descendants to participate in it.\n\nNow I just need to figure out what to do with this..."

Upon arrival at the mansion I talked to the man: asked him about his wife and family, spoke about politics and the news and appreciated a cup of the greatest Chalcidician wine I have ever tasted. My host soon became curious why I had become; his eyes lit up when a showed him the armour. I told him about its origins and hinted at its usage during the [ROOT.Char.Custom('FamousBattle')].\nRed-cheeked and excitedly voiced, the man behaved as if he fallen for a beautiful, young woman. He enthousiastically allowed me to name my price. Correctly guessing his mood, I asked for a high amount of money but one he would not have trouble paying. By the time I left the man's residence, I was carrying two heavy pouches of silver."

I quietly set down the crate with the armour, removed it from its coverings and let it speak for itself. The collector paced around the crate I had placed the bronze equipment on, pausing occasionally to inspect it. Finally, he sat down and offered his price. After a few rounds of haggling, both of us reached an agreeable price and I left feeling satisfied."

I rushed towards his residence, sweating profusely by the time I arrived. I asked the collector whether he would like to buy the most pristine armour he would ever lay his eyes on. I was surprised when, after the collector inspected it, he noted it was corroded, made by bad craftsmen and would sooner dine in the Kakodaimonistaí before displaying this piece in his collection.

I approached the man and showed the armour to him. He weighed the items on his scales and proposed to buy them for a reasonable price.
