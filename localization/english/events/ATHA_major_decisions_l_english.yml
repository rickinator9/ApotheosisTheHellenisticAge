  greece_decisions.0001.desc:0 "The years following the $battle_leuktra$ were marked by defeat after humiliating defeat. Those painful years saw us become a mere backwater: unworthy of conquest, we were an embarrassment to our forefathers and an insult to their proud deeds.\n\nBut thankfully, that is all in the past—under my guidance, the Lakedaimonians have clawed their way back from the brink and now stand on the precipice of greatness. With [messenia.GetNameNoTier] under our rightful control and the Arkadian threat reduced, we are in a strong position to re-establish [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier] as the #EMP hēgemōn#! of all free Greeks." 
  greece_decisions.0001.a:0 "As for the [messenia.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip]s, they must pay for their insolence." 
  greece_decisions.0001.a.tt:0 "The people of [messenia.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] will be enslaved!" 
  greece_decisions.0001.b:0 "We shall be gracious in victory." 
  greece_decisions.0001.b.tt:0 "The people of [messenia.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] will be granted #EMP períoikoi#! status." 

  greece_decisions.0002.t:0 "A Resurgent [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]?" 
  greece_decisions.0002.desc:0 "For many years, the [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName] has been in a position of relative weakness, the glory days of Thermopýlai long past. Now, however, [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetTitledFirstName] has been able to restore much of [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetHerHis] country's former strength, and seems poised to become a dominant player in the affairs of $k_hellas$." 
  greece_decisions.0002.desc_a:0 "\n\nThe first act of this resurgent state has been to enslave the people of [messenia.GetNameNoTier], who had traditionally been under the Spartan thumb as #EMP Heílōtes#!. Indeed, it seems that [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is seeking to take things back to how they were, and [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetHerHis] hegemonic ambitions certainly offer reason for lesser realms to be concerned." 
  greece_decisions.0002.desc_b:0 "\n\nIn an unusual display of magnanimity, the Spartans have granted the people of [messenia.GetNameNoTier] the status of #EMP períoikoi#!, guaranteeing them some degree of individual freedom. This is certainly a stunning contrast to the brutal servitude they once endured under [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip] rule, and is perhaps a sign that [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] seeks to lead [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetHerHis] realm down a new path." 
  greece_decisions.0002.a:0 "An interesting development..." 
  greece_decisions.0002.a_pythian:0 "This cruelty must not go unpunished!" 
  greece_decisions.0002.b:0 "It seems we are dealing with a milder Sparta, at least." 

  greece_decisions.0003.t:0 "The Third [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip] League" 
  greece_decisions.0003.desc:0 "Today, we may still stand in the shadow of empires, but our world is changing. No longer do we suffer the sight of our temples ravished, forts garrisoned and treasuries plundered by foreigners calling themselves gods. We are once again the masters of our own [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip], and at the same time we are re-establishing alliances and rebuilding our presence across the Aegean.\n\nNow, as our influence recovers, it is pertinent that we organise some form of league to mobilise the cities under our sway. However, the question remains: should act as a $hegemon_king$ to them, like in the days of the great $Perikles$, or as an equal partner? As [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName], I ultimately have the final say as we take this crucial step towards a new golden age for [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier]." 
  greece_decisions.0003.a:0 "Let's extort them like the good old days!" 
  greece_decisions.0003.b:0 "We shall be hegemons, but our rule will be just." 
  greece_decisions.0003.c:0 "We should give all members an equal say to ensure stability."

  greece_decisions.0004.desc:0 "When [k_athenai_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier] first lost its independence to the Macedonian kings, many expected the $polis_county$ to wither away into irrelevancy. Those few men who sought to turn the tide of affairs were met only with scorn and death, and years of war and siege took their toll as villages were abandoned and fields left untilled.\n\nYet that was not to be the end—under the leadership of [k_athenai_founder.GetTitledFirstName], this stubborn city has been able to not just survive, but flourish. With the $c_peiraieus$ garrison expelled and the port reclaimed, Athenian ships once again make their presence known across the Aegean.\n\nNow, [k_athenai_founder.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has announced the creation of a new [k_athenai_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip], " 
  greece_decisions.0004.desc_a:0 "with [k_athenai_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] securely at the helm. Clearly inspired by those golden days of $Perikles$, [k_athenai_founder.GetSheHe] has already begun discussing the tribute obligations of [k_athenai_founder.GetHerHis] new subjects." 
  greece_decisions.0004.desc_b:0 "with [k_athenai_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] securely at the helm. Following the lead of the Second League, [k_athenai_founder.GetSheHe] has taken a diplomatic approach which promises to respect the autonomy of those cities under [k_athenai_founder.GetHerHis] sway." 
  greece_decisions.0004.desc_c:0 "one that abandons hegemonic ambitions and instead upholds autonomy and equal representation. Wary of repeating [k_athenai_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]'s past mistakes, [k_athenai_founder.GetHerHis] actions herald a marked shift in the city's foreign policy."

  anatolia_decisions.0001.desc:0 "From the day we first set foot in what is now our homeland, we have fiercely fought to protect our humble villages from those who wished to exploit and conquer us. None of them, not even the Kings of Kings, could force us into that ignoble servitude which befell many of our neighbours. We outlasted those Empires, and it is finally our turn to go forth and conquer.\n\nHowever, our realm is in urgent need of reform if we are to be taken seriously. We must look past petty tribal differences and unite under one [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip]. We also need a permanent capital, one that befits my royal status and can truly compete with other seats of power."

But now, under the leadership of [k_bithynia_founder.GetTitledFirstName], they are taking the offensive: having consolidated and expanded into more fertile lands, they occupy several important cities and look to transform themselves into a regional power.\n\nIndeed, [k_bithynia_founder.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has marked this occasion in grand fashion, founding the [new_bithynian_capital_barony.GetName] as a capital for [k_bithynia_founder.GetHerHis] new [k_bithynia_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip]. It seems certain that this royal seat will be influential for years to come, though it remains to be seen whether the rest of [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] will enjoy this same fate."
