Our hard-earned riches were diverted to kings and local dynasts so they could beautify their estates while our people struggled to survive.\n\nAt times, our fellow Greeks from the mainland have given us freedom, yet we have learnt that they cannot be trusted to preserve it. For after coming as liberators, they remained as tyrants and demanded the same tribute that we once paid to the barbarians.\n\nToday, I also announce the freedom of [ionian_kingdom.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], but this time it is different. For we now rule ourselves, with no foreigner able to extort us or meddle with our constitutions.
