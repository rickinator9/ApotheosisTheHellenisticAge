  greece_decisions.0001.desc:0 "The years following the $battle_leuktra$ were marked by defeat after humiliating defeat. Those painful years saw us become a mere backwater: unworthy of conquest, we were an embarrassment to our forefathers and an insult to their proud deeds.\n\nBut thankfully, that is all in the past—under my guidance, the Lakedaimonians have clawed their way back from the brink and now stand on the precipice of greatness. With [messenia.GetNameNoTier] under our rightful control and the Arkadian threat reduced, we are in a strong position to re-establish [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier] as the #EMP hēgemōn#! of all free Greeks." 
  greece_decisions.0001.a:0 "As for the [messenia.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip]s, they must pay for their insolence."

  greece_decisions.0002.desc:0 "For many years, the [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName] has been in a position of relative weakness, the glory days of Thermopýlai long past. Now, however, [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetTitledFirstName] has been able to restore much of [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetHerHis] country's former strength, and seems poised to become a dominant player in the affairs of $k_hellas$." 
  greece_decisions.0002.desc_a:0 "\n\nThe first act of this resurgent state has been to enslave the people of [messenia.GetNameNoTier], who had traditionally been under the Spartan thumb as #EMP heílōtes#!. Indeed, it seems that [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is seeking to take things back to how they were, and [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetHerHis] hegemonic ambitions certainly offer reason for lesser realms to be concerned." 
  greece_decisions.0002.desc_b:0 "\n\nIn an unusual display of magnanimity, the Spartans have granted the people of [messenia.GetNameNoTier] the status of #EMP períoikoi#!, guaranteeing them some degree of individual freedom. This is certainly a stunning contrast to the brutal servitude they once endured under [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip] rule, and is perhaps a sign that [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] seeks to lead [k_lakedaimon_founder.GetHerHis] realm down a new path."

  greece_decisions.0003.desc:0 "Today, we may still stand in the shadow of empires, but our world is changing. No longer do we suffer the sight of our temples ravished, forts garrisoned and treasuries plundered by foreigners calling themselves gods. We are once again the masters of our own [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip], and at the same time we are re-establishing alliances and rebuilding our presence across the Aegean.\n\nNow, as our influence recovers, it is pertinent that we organise some form of league to mobilise the cities under our sway. However, the question remains: should act as a $hegemon_king$ to them, like in the days of the great $Perikles$, or as an equal partner? As [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName], I ultimately have the final say as we take this crucial step towards a new golden age for [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier]."

  greece_decisions.0004.desc:0 "When [k_athenai_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier] first lost its independence to the Macedonian kings, many expected the $polis_county$ to wither away into irrelevancy. Those few men who sought to turn the tide of affairs were met only with scorn and death, and years of war and siege took their toll as villages were abandoned and fields left untilled.\n\nYet that was not to be the end—under the leadership of [k_athenai_founder.GetTitledFirstName], this stubborn city has been able to not just survive, but flourish. With the $c_peiraieus$ garrison expelled and the port reclaimed, Athenian ships once again make their presence known across the Aegean.\n\nNow, [k_athenai_founder.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has announced the creation of a new [k_athenai_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip], "

  greece_decisions.0005.desc:0 "Our beautiful $polis_county$ attracts pilgrims, merchants and immigrants from the world over. Our institutions speak to our unwavering love of opportunity and justice. Our excellence incites envy among our foes, and for a time this was our undoing—first the Lakedaimonians, then the Thebans, then the Makedonians sought to tear us down until we were at their mercy.\n\nYet, in spite of all that has been thrown at us—the sieges, the wars, the pillaging—we have rebuilt our wooden walls, and we have humbled those great kings who saw us as mere playthings. The Aegean, and the rich cities along its coasts, are indisputably ours.\n\nAlthough my achievements are significant, I am but the latest in a succession of Athenians who have shaped our city and our world for good; I can only hope that I too am remembered for my deeds."

Even her enemies cannot deny the indelible mark her many philosophers, orators, sculptors and playwrights have on left on future generations.\n\nYet her fame has not necessarily been a guarantor of political primacy. There were times when the city was forced into submission and punished for its hubris. There were times when she was at the mercy of foreign #EMP phroúrarchoi#! and imposed tyrants.\n\nSo who could have possibly thought, after all these years, that we would see [e_athenai_founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] once more return to the forefront of the Greek world and proudly declare her hegemony over the whole Aegean? And what should be said for [e_athenai_founder.GetTitledFirstName], the [e_athenai_founder.GetWomanMan] who has defied all expectations by bringing her to this point? Whatever one's personal view of [e_athenai_founder.GetHerHim], [e_athenai_founder.GetSheHe] will surely be remembered for generations to come."
