No longer awaiting dispatches or demands, I can go about my daily business content in the knowledge that I answer to no one. The people of [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] recognise this too, and are beginning to call me the #EMP [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName]#! of this land."
  ATHA_government.0001.desc_count:0 "\n\nI must not be complacent however. If I die before I have truly consolidated myself as a dynast, it is likely the people won't be quite so generous to my successor, who may be forced to work within the framework of [city_state|L] governance."

I hear some now call me a petty tyrant, or even demand that I be held accountable to #EMP them#!. Worst of all, the view that I am no more than the head of a lowly [city_state|L] is rapidly gaining momentum."
  ATHA_government.0002.desc_b:0 "\n\nIt is clear that if I want to survive, I'll need to start acting as a citizen and not a #EMP [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName]#!.
