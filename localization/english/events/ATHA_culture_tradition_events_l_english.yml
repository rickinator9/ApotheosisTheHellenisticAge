Many people feel that the gift I received several months ago from [ceremonial_gift_giver.GetName] has not been matched to [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetCulture.GetName] standards. I need to give [ceremonial_gift_giver.GetFirstName] some kind of gift, lest I become a pariah."

  ATHA_culture_tradition.0001.b:0 "I will pay in kind."

I stood and opened the chest, revealing it contents: piles of gold and silver coins.\n\nThis great gift fulfills [ceremonial_gift_receiver.GetFirstName]'s obligation under [ceremonial_gift_receiver.GetCulture.GetName] traditions to reciprocate my own gift with an even greater gift."

[ceremonial_gift_receiver.GetSheHe] explained that [ceremonial_gift_receiver.GetSheHe] was not capable of giving me a better gift than I had given [ceremonial_gift_receiver.GetHerHim]. As a substitute, [ceremonial_gift_receiver.GetFirstName] promised to do all [ceremonial_gift_receiver.GetSheHe] could do help me in my future ambitions.
