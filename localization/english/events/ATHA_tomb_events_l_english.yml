  ATHA_tomb.0001.desc:0 "Now that I have chosen to build a tomb, my advisors are up in a hurry to advise worthy locations for my tomb. One advisor suggests to build in a secluded area with little human habitation, so as to limit the chance of looting. Another proposes to build it right outside town, to give the inhabitants an eternal display of my power.\nRegardless of their merit, it will be my choice that matters. The court is awaiting my decision for a location for my home in the next life."

Climbing the hill along with me were my attendants, some responsible for the digging while others carried the sacrifice itself. At the top of the mound, we started digging. In time, the hole was large enough to contain our offering to [tomb_occupant.GetFirstName]. My servants brought forth..."

However, [sex_courtier.GetHerHis] beauty was not what I noticed about [sex_courtier.GetHerHim]; it was rather [sex_courtier.GetHerHis] ill-disguised stare at my body and face.\n\n[sex_courtier.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was not the only one. Since I sacrificed to [tomb_occupant.GetHerHim] a few months ago, [tomb_occupant.GetTitledFirstName] has absolutely bestowed [tomb_occupant.GetHerHis] blessings upon me. Since my sacrifice, any blemishes have disappeared from my body, my confidence has been enhanced and I am clearly brimming with sexual energy. [sex_courtier.GetWomenMen|U] have not failed to notice this, for their eyes have repeatedly wandered across my body. I need only give a small nudge and I'd find myself entangled with one."

  ATHA_tomb.0112.desc:0 "I am most impressed when I inspect the musculature in my arms, shoulders and legs. To my amazement, my strength has improved leaps and bounds over the past few months. Many physical activities, like battlefield training, carrying lumber and reeling in a fish, have become much less challenging with this newly found power!\n\nIt started a few months ago...? It is of course [tomb_occupant.GetFirstName] who is giving me this force and vigor! The Overpowerer has seen kindly to my sacrifice and has granted me [tomb_occupant.GetHerHis|U] strength."

  ATHA_tomb.0113.desc:0 "The men carried their heavy wagons through the village. The mountains of grain, vegetables and fruits stacked upon the wagons were making their way towards granaries and local markets. Soon the food will feed the people of [prosperous_county.GetNameNoTier].\n\nFor the past few weeks, farmers have been preoccupied with collecting the bounteous harvest of the earth. The fruits and vegetables have never been seen larger, grains stalks never longer and tubers never denser. Although learned scholars have claimed that there is no doubt that the plentiful rains and sun have benefited our harvest, my priests instead feel we owe [tomb_occupant.GetFirstName] for [tomb_occupant.GetHerHis] benefaction!"

I lose my balance as the earth shifts and fall to the floor, as do my guards. I lose track of what happened next.\n\nAlthough my residence remained largely unscathed, the earthquake has been devastating for [capital_province.GetName]. Much of the region has been affected and many buildings have collapsed. It will certainly take some time until my lands have recovered fully.\n\nThe tremors of the earth appeared a few days before the devastating earthquake. My religious advisors attribute them to the building rage of [tomb_occupant.GetFirstName], who they suggest was unhappy with the sacrifice made a few months ago. But surely, [tomb_occupant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] would not punish us so?"
  ATHA_tomb.0201.a:0 "The people must be aided in rebuilding."

All the valuable gold treasures [tomb_occupant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was buried with have been taken and in the process [tomb_looter.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]'s forces have scattered [tomb_occupant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]'s bones in humiliation."
