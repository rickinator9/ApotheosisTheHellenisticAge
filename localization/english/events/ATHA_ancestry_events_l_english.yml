  ancestry.0001.t:0 "A Great Ancestor"
  ancestry.0001.desc:0 "Considering the achievements of the [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetName] dynasty, it does not seem so far-fetched that we would count [ancestor.GetFirstName] and [ancestor.GetHerHis] distinguished kin among our ancestors. Yet it is one thing to make a claim, and another thing to actually #emp convince#! others of its truth.\n\nThere is surely no better way to persuade people than with decisive evidence, though of course this is easier said than done. We would need to invest time, and resources, as we mobilise servants, bureaucrats and scribes to comb through archives and investigate leads."

  ancestry.0002.desc:0 "Just as I am starting to lose hope of finding any new evidence for my bold claims, [chancellor.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] approaches me with a broad grin. Apparently, not far from [barony.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] there is a most ancient tomb belonging to an otherwise forgotten kins[real_ancestor.GetWomanMan] of [ancestor.GetFirstName].\n\nIt will not be easy to find, [chancellor.GetSheHe] warns me, but it could be the missing link we are looking for. \"Perhaps you would be willing to join me on an expedition around [barony.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]?\""

Readying myself for another false alarm, I sigh and look back. \"There is nothing th—\"\n\nThen I notice it. What I had first dismissed as a rocky outcrop... a collapsed doorway!\n\nI feel the anticipation build as we quickly move to clear out the stones..."
  ancestry.0003.a:0 "With a deep breath, I enter the tomb."

  ancestry.0004.desc:0 "As I step forward, I am met with a rush of cold air that causes me to momentarily hesitate.

As I turn to call my attendants, I almost knock over something: [real_ancestor.Custom('FigurineType')] [real_ancestor.Custom('FigurineMaterial')] figurine, holding what seems to be [ancestor.Custom('AncestorSymbol')].

  ancestry.0005.desc:0 "This is going nowhere. Though it has only been a week, it feels like we have been wandering this damned countryside of [barony.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] for years. I am sure we are going in circles, as I find myself becoming intimately familiar with every plant, every stone.\n\nEvery now and then, [chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] will pipe up in excitement, pointing to yet another unremarkable tumulus or cliff. [chancellor.GetSheHe|U] will then insist that we spend at least an hour looking over every nook and cranny in the off-chance we find something. And every single time... absolutely nothing!\n\nI am at my wit's end, and by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]—if I have to hear [chancellor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] call out \"Look [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], this has to be it!\" one more time..."
