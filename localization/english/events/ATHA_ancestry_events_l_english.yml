  ancestry.0001.t:0 "A Great Ancestor"
  ancestry.0001.desc:0 "Considering the achievements of the [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetName] dynasty, it does not seem so far-fetched that we would count [ancestor.GetFirstName] and [ancestor.GetHerHis] distinguished kin among our ancestors. Yet it is one thing to make a claim, and another thing to actually #emp convince#! others of its truth.\n\nThere is surely no better way to persuade people than with decisive evidence, though of course this is easier said than done. We would need to invest time, and resources, as we mobilise servants, bureaucrats and scribes to comb through archives and investigate leads."
  ancestry.0001.a:0 "I can only spend a small amount on this."
  ancestry.0001.a_tt:0 "Lower chance of finding evidence to increase your [claim_strength|E]."
  ancestry.0001.b:0 "A decent investment should give us a decent outcome."
  ancestry.0001.b_tt:0 "Average chance of finding evidence to increase your [claim_strength|E]."
  ancestry.0001.c:0 "We shall spare no expense!"
  ancestry.0001.c_tt:0 "Higher chance of finding evidence to increase your [claim_strength|E]."
  ancestry.0001.d:0 "Making it up as we go would be #emp much#! cheaper..."
  ancestry.0001.d_tt:0 "You decide not to look for evidence that might increase your [claim_strength|E]. This will likely lead to a higher [claim_risk|E]!"

  ancestry.0002.t:0 "Great Ancestor: A Promising Tomb"
  ancestry.0002.desc:0 "Just as I am starting to lose hope of finding any new evidence for my bold claims, [chancellor.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] approaches me with a broad grin. Apparently, not far from [barony.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] there is a most ancient tomb belonging to an otherwise forgotten kins[real_ancestor.GetWomanMan] of [ancestor.GetFirstName].\n\nIt will not be easy to find, [chancellor.GetSheHe] warns me, but it could be the missing link we are looking for. \"Perhaps you would be willing to join me on an expedition around [barony.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]?\""
  ancestry.0002.a:0 "This is certainly worth investigating."
  ancestry.0002.b:0 "Thank you, this is more than enough evidence."

  ancestry.0003.t:0 "Great Ancestor: A Fruitful Expedition"
  ancestry.0003.desc:0 "As we spend yet another day fruitlessly wandering the countryside of [barony.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], a keen-eyed attendant suddenly stops us and gestures to the unassuming [real_ancestor.Custom('TombType')] we have just passed. Readying myself for another false alarm, I sigh and look back. \"There is nothing th—\"\n\nThen I notice it. What I had first dismissed as a rocky outcrop... a collapsed doorway!\n\nI feel the anticipation build as we quickly move to clear out the stones..."
  ancestry.0003.a:0 "With a deep breath, I enter the tomb."

  ancestry.0004.t:0 "Great Ancestor: Into the Tomb"
  ancestry.0004.desc:0 "As I step forward, I am met with a rush of cold air that causes me to momentarily hesitate. Recovering my composure, I raise my torch and cautiously look around.\n\nI am in a [real_ancestor.Custom('TombSize')] [real_ancestor.Custom('TombShape')] chamber, the walls [real_ancestor.Custom('TombWalls')]. [real_ancestor.Custom('TombContents')].\n\nIn the centre of the room stands [real_ancestor.Custom('GraveAdjective')] [real_ancestor.Custom('GraveType')] [real_ancestor.Custom('GraveDecoration')]."
  ancestry.0004.desc_1:0 "Examining it more closely, I can make out the emblem of my own dynasty! As I turn to call my attendants, I almost knock over something: [real_ancestor.Custom('FigurineType')] [real_ancestor.Custom('FigurineMaterial')] figurine, holding what seems to be [ancestor.Custom('AncestorSymbol')]. Could this be a depiction of [ancestor.GetName] [ancestor.GetHerselfHimself]?"
  ancestry.0004.desc_2:0 "Examining it more closely, I can make out the emblem of my own dynasty! But my excitement soon fades as I realise there is nothing here that links the occupant of this tomb to [ancestor.GetFirstName]."
  ancestry.0004.desc_3:0 "It also depicts– wait, is that [ancestor.GetFirstName]... trampling the emblem of #emp my#! dynasty?"
  ancestry.0004.desc_4:0 "It even has the emblem of my own dynasty! As I turn to call my attendants, I almost knock over something: [real_ancestor.Custom('FigurineType')] [real_ancestor.Custom('FigurineMaterial')] figurine, holding [new_ancestor.Custom('AncestorSymbol')]. Wait... is that not the [new_ancestor.Custom('AncestorAdjective')] [new_ancestor.GetFirstName]?"
  ancestry.0004.1_a:0 "This is just the evidence I needed."
  ancestry.0004.2_a:0 "Did the locals not say this was [ancestor.Custom('AncestorLineInDef')] tomb?"
  ancestry.0004.2_b:0 "If we just write \"The [real_ancestor.Custom('GetDaughterSon')|U] of [ancestor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]\" on this wall here..."
  ancestry.0004.2_b.critical_success:0 "You create a convincing forgery"
  ancestry.0004.2_b.success:0 "Your forgery is only somewhat convincing"
  ancestry.0004.2_b.failure:0 "You bungle the forgery"
  ancestry.0004.3_a:0 "Did I just get mocked by an old tomb painting?"
  ancestry.0004.3_b:0 "No one will know if we just paint over it..."
  ancestry.0004.3_b.success:0 "You manage to conceal the problematic image"
  ancestry.0004.3_b.failure:0 "You do a poor job of covering up the image"
  ancestry.0004.3_c:0 "Tear it all down and scatter the bones!"
  ancestry.0004.3_c.success:0 "The destruction of the tomb goes unnoticed"
  ancestry.0004.3_c.failure:0 "You dismantle the tomb, but rumour spreads of your sacrilegious actions"
  ancestry.0004.3_c.critical_failure:0 "Local peasants stop you from destroying the tomb"
  ancestry.0004.4_a:0 "So... I am actually descended from [new_ancestor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]?"

  ancestry.0005.t:0 "Great Ancestor: A Fruitless Expedition"
  ancestry.0005.desc:0 "This is going nowhere. Though it has only been a week, it feels like we have been wandering this damned countryside of [barony.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] for years. I am sure we are going in circles, as I find myself becoming intimately familiar with every plant, every stone.\n\nEvery now and then, [chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] will pipe up in excitement, pointing to yet another unremarkable tumulus or cliff. [chancellor.GetSheHe|U] will then insist that we spend at least an hour looking over every nook and cranny in the off-chance we find something. And every single time... absolutely nothing!\n\nI am at my wit's end, and by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]—if I have to hear [chancellor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] call out \"Look [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], this has to be it!\" one more time..."
  ancestry.0005.a:0 "[chancellor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], this is the #emp fifth#! time you have pointed out that mound!"
