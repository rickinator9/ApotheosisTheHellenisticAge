 bm_275_greece:0 "The Fetters of Greece"
 bm_275_greece_desc:1 "Ever since the passing of Alexander the Great, the lands of Greece have been the scene of constant battles between his successors. However, with the kings of Macedonia and Epirus engaged elsewhere recently the free cities have been able to breathe a sigh of relief. Their relief, however, is not to last long: both kings have turned their gaze southward once more, and unless the fortresses of Corinth, Chalkis and Demetrias can be liberated, the Greek cities will inevitably remain at the mercy of their powerful northern neighbours.\n\n#bold The lands of Greece are waiting to be united once more! Will the new hegemon be an ambitious king, a league of free cities or a single great city-state?#!"

 bookmark_greece_pyrrhus_of_epirus_desc:0 "Nicknamed “Aietos” (the Eagle) for his soaring ambition and stunning victories in battle, Pyrrhus of Epirus is truly the greatest general of his time. However, he has yet to make something of his talents. His campaigns in Italy were ultimately inconclusive, and his treasury is running dry from years of war. Nevertheless, back in Epirus he is ready to begin a new adventure. He will reclaim Macedon from Antigonus Gonatas before heading south to the Peloponnese, where instead of finding glory and new conquests, he will lose his eldest son before falling in the midst of a chaotic street-battle, brought down by a roof-tile.\n\n#bold Do you have what it takes to realise Pyrrhus’ ambitions, or is the last great Aeacid doomed to an ignoble death at the hands of an old woman?#!"

 bookmark_greece_antigonus_gonatas_desc:0 "Eight years ago, Antigonus’ father Demetrius Poliorcetes died in captivity, leaving him extensive claims but few means to press them. Now, after a brilliant victory against the Gauls ravaging his homelands, he sits on the Macedonian throne but his position is far from secure - he will lose almost everything when Pyrrhus invades, his garrisoned cities yearn for freedom, and the Ptolemaic thalassocracy seeks to expand into Greece. Despite these numerous threats, he will eventually come out on top, becoming a respected patron of artists and philosophers and securing his family’s place in history.\n\n#bold Will you have the skill, and luck, to overcome those who seek to challenge your rule? Will you usher in a new era of stability and prosperity for Macedon?#!"

 bookmark_greece_cleonymus_of_sparta_desc:0 "Passed over for succession of the Agiad throne in Sparta due to his violent and arbitrary tendencies, Cleonymus sought to create his own fortune as a mercenary leader. Following an expedition to Italy and a brief stint as ruler of Corfu, he has returned home only to be met with humiliation as his young wife falls in love with Acrotatus, son of the current king and his own grand-nephew. Deeply bitter, he will make a futile attempt to claim the throne and end his days in exile, though his son Leonidas will eventually rule Sparta.\n\n#bold Can you change the course of fate by claiming what is rightfully yours and exacting revenge on those who have wronged you?#!"

 bookmark_greece_areus_desc:0 "The latest in a long line of Agiad kings, Areus has inherited a Sparta vastly different from the realm which won eternal glory at Thermopylae. Her ancient traditions are fading, her armies weakening and her population dwindling. It would take a leader of great strength and courage to halt this decline, and Areus certainly isn’t afraid to try. However, as he has already learned from his campaigns in Phocis, the other Greek cities are wary of a Spartan resurgence and won’t be easily fooled into thinking otherwise. His efforts will ultimately fail, as he dies in battle under the walls of Corinth, and the city of Sparta is doomed to fall only forty years later.\n\n#bold With shrewd rule and good fortune, can Sparta’s decline be delayed, or even undone altogether?#!"

 bookmark_greece_callippus_of_eleusis_desc:0 "Born to a prominent Eleusinian family, Callippus was part of a new generation of Athenian politicians who emerged after the revolt against Demetrius Poliorcetes. Like his father, the renowned orator Moerocles, he has been a staunch defender of Athenian independence, demonstrating this through his command of the forces who fought back the Galatian tide at Thermopylae four years ago. A highly respected figure, he will play a leading role in negotiating the alliance of Greek cities against Macedonian hegemony, though unfortunately for him these efforts will prove fruitless and the eventual fall of Athens will cause him to fade into obscurity.\n\n#bold Athens needs a hero. Will you defend the desperate city in its twilight and achieve a lasting legacy for yourself and your family?#!"
