 bm_275_greece:0 "The Fetters of Greece"
 bm_275_greece_desc:1 "Ever since the passing of Alexander the Great, the lands of Greece have been the scene of constant battles between his successors. Only recently, with the kings of Macedonia and Epirus engaged elsewhere, have the free cities been able to breathe a sigh of relief. However, it is only a matter of time before these kings turn their gaze southward once more, and unless the fortresses of Corinth, Chalcis and Demetrias can be liberated, the Greek #emp póleis#! will remain at the mercy of their powerful northern neighbours.\n\n#bold The lands of Greece are waiting to be united once more! Will the new hegemon be an ambitious king, a league of free cities or a single great #emp pólis#!?#!"

 bookmark_greece_pyrrhus_of_epirus_desc:0 "Nicknamed “Aietos” (the Eagle) for his soaring ambition and stunning victories in battle, Pyrrhus of Epirus is truly the greatest general of his time. However, he has yet to make something of his talents. His campaigns in Italy were ultimately inconclusive, and his treasury is running dry from years of war. Nevertheless, back in Epirus he is ready to begin a new adventure. He will reclaim Macedon from Antigonus Gonatas before heading south to the Peloponnese, where instead of finding glory and new conquests, he will lose his eldest son before falling in the midst of a chaotic street-battle, brought down by a roof-tile.\n\n#bold Do you have what it takes to realise Pyrrhus’ ambitions, or is the last great Aeacid doomed to an ignoble death at the hands of an old woman?#!"

Now, after a brilliant victory against the Gauls ravaging his homelands, he sits on the Macedonian throne. Yet his position is far from secure—Pyrrhus plots restlessly at his border, his garrisoned cities yearn for freedom, and the Ptolemaic thalassocracy draws ever closer. Despite these numerous threats, Antigonus will eventually come out on top, becoming a respected patron of artists and philosophers and securing his family’s place in history.\n\n#bold Will you have the skill, and luck, to overcome those who seek to challenge your rule? Will you usher in a new era of stability and prosperity for Macedon?#!"

Following an expedition to Italy and a brief stint as ruler of Corcyra, he has returned home only to be met with humiliation as his young wife falls in love with Acrotatus, son of the current king and his own grand-nephew. Deeply bitter, he will make a futile attempt to claim the throne and end his days in exile, though his son Leonidas will eventually rule Sparta.\n\n#bold Can you change the course of fate by claiming what is rightfully yours and exacting revenge on those who have wronged you?#!"

Her ancient traditions are fading, her armies weakening and her population dwindling. It would take a leader of great strength and courage to halt this decline, and Areus certainly isn’t afraid to try. However, as he has already learned from his campaigns in Phocis, the other Greek cities are wary of a Spartan resurgence and won’t be easily fooled into thinking otherwise. His efforts will ultimately fail, as he dies in battle under the walls of Corinth, and the city of Sparta is doomed to fall only forty years later.\n\n#bold With shrewd rule and good fortune, can Sparta’s decline be slowed, or even undone altogether?#!"

Like his father, the renowned orator Moerocles, he has been a staunch defender of Athenian independence, demonstrating this through his command of the forces who fought back the Galatian tide at Thermopylae four years ago. A highly respected figure, he will play a leading role in negotiating the alliance of Greek cities against Macedonian hegemony, though unfortunately for him these efforts will prove fruitless and the eventual fall of Athens will cause him to fade into obscurity.\n\n#bold Athens needs a hero.

 bm_275_illyria:0 "Shores of Opportunity"
 bm_275_illyria_desc:1 "The Celtic migrations abruptly changed Illyria: the large Autariat kingdom collapsed and Pannonia saw large amounts of Celtic settlement. In this tumultuous environment, many leaders despaired but a few saw this as a distinct opportunity for further greatness. For Illyria is wealthy: its broken shores boast many pirates bringing home booty, its vast mountain ranges conceal vast amounts of gold and silver and the Danubian flatlands provide plenty of food. A clever leader uses that wealth to build a kingdom to stand the test of time. Kingdoms rise and fall, but the tales told of their founders are never forgotten.\n\n#bold Illyria is fertile ground for a new legend to rise. Will you become that legendary king, chieftain or citizen?#!"

It was his father, Glaukías, who sheltered Pyrrhus of Epirus from Macedonian approaches and Monounios himself supported Lysimachus' son, Ptolemy, in Macedonian civil wars. Pyrrhus, however, repaid the hospitality shown to him by seizing Taulantian land! Further threats emerge from the north, where the Ardiaei have founded a powerful kingdom. It was these same Ardiaei that brought the Taulantian kingdom to its end within less than 50 years as they expanded towards Epirus.\n\n#bold Will you prove Monounios' supremacy as Illyrian king over the Ardiaei and punish Pyrrhus for his transgressions?#!"

Little more than five years later, King Leon has reconsolidated the ancient kingdom that was ruled by his family. Leon faces a difficult political situation: not only is his kingdom devastated, but it is also sandwiched between the larger realms of the Macedonians and Dardanians; the same peoples that have continually encroached upon Paeonian territory and made it their own. Leon and his successors would fail to overcome these neighbours. Paeonia became a part of Macedonia by 217 BC and lost its identity following the Roman conquest.\n\n#bold Can you lead Leon to overcome Macedonia and restore Paeonian habitation to Lower Macedonia?#!"

 bookmark_illyria_bathanattos_desc:0 "The defeat at Delphi left the Celtic army scattered; it was in these circumstances that Bathanattos led the Scordisci north to Singidunum, a location that controls important trade routes along the Danube river. The Celtic minority in mostly Illyrian and Thracian lands provides a unique challenge, but also opportunity. Should these peoples be accepted into the tribe, the Scordisci are poised to exploit the weakened Triballi and Autariat kingdoms. The Scordisci would conquer a huge Balkan empire and successfully integrate the Thracian and Illyrian majorities into their tribe. They ultimately fell to Roman invasions, but not before the Scordisci could avenge their Celtic brethren: around 80 BC, 200 years after their defeat, Scordisci Celts successfully sacked Delphi.\n\n#bold Will you found a Celtic state to stand the test of time and avenge your fallen Celtic brothers?#!"

His people recently moved to the coast from the hinterland and established their supremacy over the neighbouring tribes. Ballaios lives in opportune times: the Autariat kingdom to his north has fallen to infighting and the Taulantians have expended their strength by intervening in Greek politics. The income stream piracy yield could fuel Ballaios' ambitions to forge a kingdom out of these weak neighbours. The Ardiaeian support for piracy would prove to be their undoing: Ballaios' descendants would be supplanted by Roman puppet rulers in Roman attempts to secure their merchants in the Adriatic.\n\n#bold Will you get Ballaios' to forge a new maritime empire and make fat merchants dread Illyrian pirates once more?#!"

 bm_275_thrace:0 "A Shattered World"
 bm_275_thrace_desc:1 "Thrace is ever a land in turmoil: its aristocrats enjoyed considerable autonomy as the Macedonians were unable to enforce their authority on the land after the death of Alexander the Great. The fall of Lysimachus suddenly turned that autonomy into full independence as Macedonian influence in the region crumbled. Some Thracian rulers aim to restore the Odrysian kingdom of old, while others seek to bring their own dynasty to the heights of power. However, the Thracians should not forget others have ambitions in the region too: numerous Celtic bands have settled within Thracian territories and Greek armies are never more than a coast or mountain pass away.\n\n#bold Thrace yearns to be united as it was in the past. Who will rise to the occasion? Will the Thracian poets speak of a Thracian demigod, a Celtic king, an urban magistrate or a Greek Basileus in the chronicles that are yet to be written?#!"

His earliest known ancestor, Teres, first united Thrace into a single polity following the Persian retreat after their disastrous invasion of Greece. That unity has unfortunately long passed, as dynastic struggles left the Odrysians vulnerable to Macedonian conquest. Hebryzelmis' father, Seuthes, is famed for re-establishing an Odrysian polity but that too has declined due to infighting among his sons. Hebryzelmis and his family will ultimately fade into history, little more than names upon a stele, and the capital of Seuthopolis abandoned.\n\n#bold Will you assert your dominance over your siblings and challenge the course of history by claiming your birthright as king over all Thrace?#!"

From their bases in the western Carpathian basin, the Celts have been moving southwards since 350 BC. Prominent leaders with a large following exploited the turmoil and weakness of Balkan states to carve out their own kingdoms. One such leader is Komontorios, establishing a large kingdom around the city of Tylis. His raids have allowed him to subject many Thracians and convinced wealthy cities to pay tribute. Unfortunately, the Komontorios' kingdom would prove short-lived as it lasted for little more than 60 years before the subject Thracians would destroy it.\n\n#bold Can you build a new, lasting home for your people in a hostile land and grow wealthy upon the Greeks' tribute?#!"

Within this space, Isanthes' territory rises out of many small tribal territories as an intermediary between all these distinct neighbouring cultures.

Although descendants of the royal Odrysian line still hold many lands, Teres is one of those aristocrats who have forged small realms in the periphery. Being situated in a central location provides Teres great opportunities to conquer, but also exposes him to aggression from multiple flanks.\nTeres is an elusive person in terms of historical evidence. He minted coins in his own name depicting a boar.

Founded on a peninsula on the straits of the Bosphorus, Byzantium is ideally located to exploit the many trading ships delivering grain to the cities of mainland Greece and has grown wealthy on this trade. Wealth, however, always attracts envious eyes. Following Celtic agression, Byzantium is forced to pay a heavy tribute to the kings of Tylis.\nThe figure of Athenaion is shrouded in shadows; his son would be honoured at Tenos halfway through this century and his possible grandson was a prominent courtier at the Ptolemaic court. It is possible that his family was a leading family of Byzantium. What is certain, however, is that Byzantium would become one of the greatest cities of the world under the names of Constantinople and Istanbul.\n\n#bold Would you relieve Byzantium of the barbarians that steal its wealth and grow it into its historic greatness?#!"
