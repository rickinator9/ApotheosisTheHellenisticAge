With the citizen masses having the final say in decisions ranging from war declarations to death sentences, a politician's ability to capture and sway becomes so much more decisive. However, as many statesmen over the course of history have discovered, the tide can rapidly turn against them if they are not careful. By the Hellenistic period, the majority of free City-States across the Greek world and beyond operated as Democracies, though such a status was never completely secure...#!"

Historically, a Tyrant's reign was often a short-lived affair, ending with their assassination and the city's liberation. Although Tyrants sterotypically tended towards paranoia and cruelty, this was not always the case: some were mild rulers who patronised artists and philosophers, and the most successful were able to establish themselves as legitimate monarchs.#!"

Barriers to holding office or otherwise participating in decision-making, such as property requirements, ensure that the political class remains small and aloof of the masses. Historically, Oligarchies were the second most common form of City-State Government after [city_state_democracies|E]. Their appeal lay in the belief that the leading citizens surely knew what was best for the realm, though the suppression of the majority's rights meant that Oligarchs were often in conflict with Democratic factions.#!"

These illustrious dynasties can go back hundreds of years, having taken steps to constitutionally bar those of low birth from ever holding high office. Historically, City-State Aristocracies, also known as narrow Oligarchies or #EMP Dynasteîai#!, were the predominant form of government in Classical Thessaly and Crete. In some cases, the ruling families achieved prominence beyond their cities, the most notable being the Aleuads of Larissa and Menonids of Pharsalus.#!"

Most notably, it was ruled by two kings, though their duties were primarily religious and militaristic by the 3rd century BC. They were expected to lead the Spartan army in the field, made religious offerings and consulted the Oracle of Delphi. The kings' power was small compared to the five Ephors, who were elected for a single year. The Ephors were the ambassadors of Sparta, oversaw campaigns led by the kings and declared war on the Helot slave population each autumn.#!"

As such, secession is a relatively common occurrence and often without bloodshed.

At this level of organisation, the Hegemon may find it difficult to preserve the integrity of the Alliance: secession is common and forcing ex-members back into the fold may not always be worthwhile. Historically, these loose Alliances could only be preserved as long as members felt they were being protected by the leading power and not exploited or subjugated by them.#!"

In the same way, the presence of common institutions may disproportionately serve the interests of the Hegemon. Historically, the parties to a Sympolity agreement weren't always; in some cases, the circumstances suggest coercion and in others the text of the agreement indicate an unequal, perhaps even exploitative, partnership.#!"

Indeed, to the observer the territories of the Coalition and the Hegemon may seem identical at this point. Historically, the establishment of a centralised Hegemonic state was a lengthy process, as it required gradually eroding the autonomy of members states and replacing local governments with centrally-appointed overseers. The ultimate outcome was often that these subjects were permanently annexed by the Hegemon.#!"
