 game_concept_temple_holding_desc:9 "Sanctuaries are a [holding_type|E] that can be held by members of the [clergy|E] as [church_property|E] (the [theocratic|E] [government_form|E]). However, in [faiths|E] with the [GetFaithDoctrine('doctrine_theocracy_lay_clergy').GetBaseName] [doctrine|E], anyone can hold Sanctuaries without penalty.\n\nSanctuaries provide a fairly even mix of [levies|E] and [taxes|E]."

 game_concept_knight_desc:9 "A $game_concept_knight$ is a [vassal|E] or [courtier|E] that fights directly in your [army|E].\n\nDuring [battles|E], $game_concept_knights$ use their [prowess_skill|E] to fight more effectively. A high $game_concept_prowess$ means that they will be able to inflict more damage on the enemy, and are more likely to survive or even emerge from $game_concept_battle$ unscathed.\n\nA character cannot be a [commander|E] and a $game_concept_knight$ at the same time.\n\n#weak Knights can be known by different names depending on [culture] or [faith]. For example, $knight_somatophylax_no_tooltip_plural$, $knight_epilektos_hoplites_no_tooltip_plural$ or $knight_hippeus_no_tooltip_plural$.\n\nKnights represent both the character and their retinue of troops.#!"
 game_concept_vassal_obligations_desc:9 "$game_concept_vassal_obligations$ define how much [tax|E] and how many [levies|E] a [vassal|E] provides to their [liege|E]. The Vassal's [government_form|E] decides what the $game_concept_vassal_obligations$ are.\n\n#weak For example, many vassals have their $game_concept_vassal_obligations$ set by their [feudal_contract|E].#!\n\n[feudal] [vassals] pay a percentage of their total [taxes] and [levies] through the #high $feudal_government_taxes$#! and #high $feudal_government_levies$#! Obligations. #EMP These [modifier_contributions|E] can in turn be modified by 'fine print' options such as [GetVassalContractType( 'coinage_rights' ).GetObligationName( 'coinage_rights_granted' )].#!"

 game_concept_feudal_contract_desc:9 "A $game_concept_feudal_contract$ specifies the [obligations|E] between a [vassal|E] and their [liege|E].

 game_concept_crown_authority:9 "Centralisation"
 game_concept_crown_authority_desc:9 "$game_concept_crown_authority$ represents the general power that a [ruler|E] wields over their [realm|E].\n\nThere are four levels of $game_concept_crown_authority$; [autonomous_vassals|E], [limited|E], [high|E], and [absolute|E]. Increasing $game_concept_crown_authority$ costs an amount of [prestige|E] depending on the level and the ruler's [learning_skill|E].\n\n#weak Vassals dislike higher levels of $game_concept_crown_authority$, and lowering it is the primary goal of [Concept( 'liberty_faction', 'Liberty Factions' )|E].#!"

 game_concept_absolute_crown_authority_desc:2 "$game_concept_absolute_crown_authority$ is the highest level of [crown_authority|E]. [vassals|E] have a #N -30#! [opinion|E] penalty toward their [liege|E].\n\nAt this level — in addition to the effects of [high|E] and [limited|E] Centralisation — the ruler can pick a [designated_heir|E] at a [prestige|E] cost.\n\nFurthermore, vassals cannot declare war even against foreign rulers."
 game_concept_tribal_authority_desc:2 "$game_concept_tribal_authority$ represents the general influence that a [tribal|E] [ruler|E] wields over their [vassals|E].
