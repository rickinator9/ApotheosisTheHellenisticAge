After his death in the Battle of Cunaxa and the murder of the mercenary commanders, Xenophon was one of the officers elected to lead the mercenaries to safety. Through trickery and sound tactical decisions, Xenophon was able to return home to Greece with 6000 of the mercenaries after a return trip lasting around a year.
