 ATHA_trait_specific.0001.desc:0 "A landowning commoner, who has been waiting to see me for several hours, enters the courtroom. They look about the room, seemingly intimidated by its splendor. After bowing deeply before me [landowner.GetSheHe] explains [landowner.GetHerHis] situation.\n\n"[corrupt_vassal.GetTitledFirstName] has been hounding me for weeks, claiming that [corrupt_vassal.GetSheHe] owns my family’s land. [corrupt_vassal.GetSheHe] can't have a claim because the land has been with my family for generations but I don’t have the resources to continue fighting [corrupt_vassal.GetHerHim]. I beg you, please step in and save my land, it’s the only thing of value my family and I have.""

 ATHA_trait_specific.0002.t:0 "A Tale of Two Claims"
 ATHA_trait_specific.0002.desc:0 "[corrupt_vassal.GetTitledFirstName] arrives at court, followed by a gaggle of supporters. "I am ready to present my case for why [landowner.GetFirstName] is squatting on my land." [corrupt_vassal.GetFirstName] launches into a purely rhetorical argument by which [corrupt_vassal.GetSheHe] and [corrupt_vassal.GetHerHis] entourage make several cutting personal remarks about [landowner.GetFirstNamePossessive] character and inability to manage the land well.\n\nConversely, [landowner.GetFirstName] makes a purely evidence based argument, producing several clay tablets with trade deals of his ancestors for goods created on the land and several neighbors attesting to [landowner.GetFirstNamePossessive] family having lived on the land for generations."
 ATHA_trait_specific.0002.a:0 "Side with [corrupt_vassal.GetTitledFirstName]"

 ATHA_trait_specific.0003.desc:0 "Having made my ruling in the courtroom, I head back toward my bedchamber for the evening, deep in thought, when a sudden voice from the shadows jolts me to attention.\n\n"Surely you have more important business to attend to than this little squabble?" [corrupt_vassal.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] voice slithers toward me as [corrupt_vassal.GetSheHe] slides into the dying light. "Perhaps, a donation to the adjudicator’s treasury might speed things along, in favor of one party of course.""
 ATHA_trait_specific.0003.a:0 "Sounds like a good deal to me"
 ATHA_trait_specific.0003.b:0 "Such a donation would help, against you!"
