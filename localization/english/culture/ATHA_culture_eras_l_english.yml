 culture_era_archaic_desc:0 "The Archaic Era saw the Near-East emerge from the Bronze Age collapse and a successively larger series of empires rose in the area. By the end of the era, most of the Near-East would be unified by the Achaemenid empire. In Greece city-state political institutions were founded and hoplite warfare took form. Elsewhere in Europe, ironworking technology spread and was widely adopted by the end of the Era."

 culture_era_classical_desc:0 "The Classical Era began with the Ionian revolt against the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Athenian intervention in the revolt lead to two Persian interventions in mainland Greece which culminated in the defeat of the Persians by a coalition of Greek states. Bickering between the Greek states soon resumed and the city-states gradually wore themselves out as a result. The historically weak kingdom of Macedonia would take advantage of the situation and eventually united most of the Greek city-states.\n\nMany military innovations were made as a result of the incessant fighting: peltasts saw their introduction, cavalry squadrons were formed, artillery was used to besiege cities for the first time and the Sarissa phalanx, which would come to dominate Greek warfare for the next three centuries, was first employed by the end of the Era. Many civic and cultural innovations were also made, such as cranes to build ever impressive buildings and refinements in philosophical methodology."
 culture_era_hellenistic:0 "Hellenistic"
 culture_era_hellenistic_desc:0 "The Hellenistic Era starts with the death of Alexander the Great. He spent most of his adult life on campaign in the Balkans and Persia. His unexpected death with a disputed succession threw his empire into civil war between his generals. These Diadochi wars would continue for 40 years, by which time his empire had divided into three states: Antigonid Macedonia, Seleucid Asia and Ptolemaic Egypt. The continuous conflicts between these states made them vulnerable to the rising Roman Republic over the next three centuries and one by one they would fall. The Hellenistic Era transitions into the Late Hellenistic Era as the Romans permanently establish their hegemony over Greece with the fall of Corinth in 146 BC.\n\nThe Greek world continued reforming their militaries by incorporating foreign (Gallic and Persian) influences, although the Hoplite and Sarissa phalanxes continued to be the core of the infantry force. In the west, Rome started using manipular formations and adapted its military following defeats to its neighbors. Hydrolic power first started to be used for industrial purposes, such as milling grain or mining. New schools of philosophy enabled people to view the world in new ways and the establishment of libraries allowed collective knowledge to be maintained and spread."
 culture_era_late_hellenistic:0 "Late Hellenistic"
 culture_era_late_hellenistic_desc:0 "The fateful destructions of Corinth and Carthage herald the start of the Late Hellenistic Era in 146 BC. After uniting Italy after the defeat of Pyrrhus of Epirus in 275 BC, the Romans rapidly started to intervene in the politics of the wider Mediterranean region and conquered an area of land never before seen in their region. With no significant external threats left, Rome increasingly began to suffer under civic strife. Military commanders acted without the consent of elected officials to achieve fame and fortune, often culminating in their seizure of power. The Roman Republic effectively died after the massively popular Julius Caesar defeated any and all senatorial opposition militarily and was appointed dictator for life. Caesar willed his power to Gaius Octavius who became emperor in all but name. The Late Hellenistic Age ends with death of Augustus in 14 CE, which ended the era of the great Roman conquests and resulted in a consolidation of imperial authority.\n\nLong distance campaigning necessitated the formation of a professional army within the Roman Republic, equipped and paid for by the state. The seizure of Greece allowed the Romans to share in the Greek innovations, such as hydrolic power and literary education."
 culture_era_imperial:0 "Imperial"
 culture_era_imperial_desc:0 "The Imperial Era starts with the death of Augustus in 14 CE. After three centuries of rapid conquest, most of the Roman borders were now stable. The next two centuries would be known as the Pax Romana, a time of peace and prosperity enabled by the authority of one state ruling the Mediterranean coast. After the Pax Romana came to an end in the reign of Commodus, civil war, increased foreign pressure and decreased imperial authority would see the Roman Empire decline until it fell in 476 CE.\n\nThe Romans used a professional army combined with irregular troops to perform military operations. The garrisons along the border caused the neighboring population to gradually adopt Roman customs and these peoples became to see themselves as Roman. The Roman Empire greatly improved infrastructure across its provinces, with roads, aqueducts and postal stations to facilitate trade and communication between different parts of the Empire."
