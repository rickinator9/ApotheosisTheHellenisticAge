 culture_era_archaic:0 "Archaic"
 culture_era_archaic_desc:0 "The Archaic Era saw the Near-East emerge from the Bronze Age collapse and a successively larger series of empires rose in the area. By the end of the era, most of the Near-East would be unified by the Achaemenid empire. In Greece city-state political institutions were founded and hoplite warfare took form. Elsewhere in Europe, ironworking technology spread and was widely adopted by the end of the Era."
 culture_era_classical:0 "Classical"
 culture_era_classical_desc:0 "The Classical Era began with the Ionian revolt against the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Athenian intervention in the revolt lead to two Persian interventions in mainland Greece which culminated in the defeat of the Persians by a coalition of Greek states. Bickering between the Greek states soon resumed and the city-states gradually wore themselves out as a result. The historically weak kingdom of Macedonia would take advantage of the situation and eventually united most of the Greek city-states.\n\nMany military innovations were made as a result of the incessant fighting: peltasts saw their introduction, cavalry squadrons were formed, artillery was used to besiege cities for the first time and the Sarissa phalanx, which would come to dominate Greek warfare for the next three centuries, was first employed by the end of the Era. Many civic and cultural innovations were also made, such as cranes to build ever impressive buildings and refinements in philosophical methodology."
 culture_era_hellenistic:0 "Hellenistic"
 culture_era_hellenistic_desc:0 "The Hellenistic Era starts with the death of Alexander the Great. He spent most of his adult life on campaign in the Balkans and Persia. His unexpected death with a disputed succession threw his empire into civil war between his generals. These Diadochi wars would continue for 40 years, by which time his empire had divided into three states: Antigonid Macedonia, Seleucid Asia and Ptolemaic Egypt. The continuous conflicts between these states made them vulnerable to the rising Roman Republic over the next three centuries and one by one they would fall. The Hellenistic Era ends with the fall of Mark Anthony and Cleopatra in 30 BC.\n\nThe Greek world continued reforming their militaries by incorporating foreign (Gallic and Persian) influences, although the Hoplite and Sarissa phalanxes continued to be the core of the infantry force. In the west, Rome started using manipular formations and established a professional army. Hydrolic power first started to be used for industrial purposes, such as milling grain or mining. Cement allowed for stronger and more impressive architecture and the establishment of libraries allowed collective knowledge to be maintained and spread."
 culture_era_imperial:0 "Imperial"
 culture_era_imperial_desc:0 "The Imperial Era starts with Octavian's victory in 30 BCE during the war of the Second Triumvirate. This lead to the creation of the Roman Empire after a century of instability within the Roman Republic. What followed for the next two centuries was a time of peace and prosperity called the Pax Romana. After the Pax Romana came to an end in the reign of Commodus, civil war, increased foreign pressure and decreased imperial authority would see the Roman Empire decline until it fell in 476 CE.\n\nThe Romans used a professional army combined with irregular troops to perform military operations. The garrisons along the border caused the neighboring population to gradually adopt Roman customs and these peoples became to see themselves as Roman. The Roman Empire greatly improved infrastructure across its provinces, with roads, aqueducts and postal stations to facilitate trade and communication between different parts of the Empire."
