In this folder, character modifiers are defined

The modifers are on the format:

modifer_key = {
	icon = icon_name
	
	# Effects, such as
	# tax_mult = 0.25
	# county_opinion_add = -30

	# Modifier can have scale that'll be calculated once when effect assigns a modifier, and later
	# remains unchanged for the entire modifier duration
	scale = {

		# Scripted value - can be named value or direct math here
		# Root scope is the object that's going to get the modifier
		# Scripted value top level description will be added to modifier description
		value = scale_scripted_value

		# Loc key that's used for base level entry, to show alongside with the scaled value
		desc = base_value_description
	}
}

"modifier_key" is the name of the modifier, that is used in effects to apply it
"icon" decides which modifier icon to use. if it ends in positive or negative, the name of the modifier will be colored appropriately
