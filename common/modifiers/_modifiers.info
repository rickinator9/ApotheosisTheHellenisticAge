In this folder, character modifiers are defined

The modifers are on the format:

modifer_key = {
	icon = icon_name
	
	# Effects, such as
	# tax_mult = 0.25
	# county_opinion_add = -30
}

"modifier_key" is the name of the modifier, that is used in effects to apply it
"icon" decides which modifier icon to use. if it ends in positive or negative, the name of the modifier will be colored appropriately
