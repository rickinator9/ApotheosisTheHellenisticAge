Although the castellieri were productive centers of autarkic character, they also served as places for exchange. From the findings made (pottery, jewelry, cinerary urns, and even statues, as in Nesactium) the contacts that the populations of the region had with the rest of the Adriatic world and even with the Aegean are evident.

With the coming of the Celts, silver processing also received a particular impetus. The manufacturing activities had a craft character: weapons of various types were manufactured, tools for agriculture, fibulae, studs and other objects intended to accompany clothing. There was also a copious production of utensils for domestic use, often of good workmanship. https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultura_dei_castellieri
