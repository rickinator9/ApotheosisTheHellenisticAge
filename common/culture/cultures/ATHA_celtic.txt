		tradition_astute_diplomats # In order to stem the Roman expansion and to acquire the fertile and more hospitable plains, the Carni tried to form alliances with the Histrian, the Iapydes, and the Taurisci Celts. As Rome, in turn, was more and more becoming aware of the impending danger coming from the Carni and as it wanted to accelerate its own expansion, it sent to the north-east the legions of consul Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, who finally defeated the Carni in the battle of 15 November 115 BCE. The Carni submitted to the Roman Republic in the 2nd century BCE, accepting its commands and its concessions. They received then the permission to populate and colonize the plain between the Julian pre-Alps and the Livenza river they had already tried to occupy previously in conflict with both the Romans and Veneti. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carni
		tradition_transhumant_shepherds # The first historical date related to the arrival of the Carni is 186 BCE, when some 50,000 Carni, composed of armed men, women and children, descended towards the plains (in which they previously used to winter) and on a hill they founded a stable defensive settlement, Akileja.
		tradition_abundant_hillforts # The first historical date related to the arrival of the Carni is 186 BCE, when some 50,000 Carni, composed of armed men, women and children, descended towards the plains (in which they previously used to winter) and on a hill they founded a stable defensive settlement, Akileja. In Istria, Friuli, and Venezia Giulia there are several hundred castles including that of Leme, in central-western Istria, of Elleri, near Muggia, of Monte Giove, near Prosecco (Trieste), of Slivia, part of the municipality of Duino-Aurisina, and of S.Polo, (or Gradiscata) not far from Monfalcone. The Castellieri were fortified settlements, usually located on hills or mountains or, more rarely (such as in Friuli), in plains. They were constituted by one or more concentric series of walls, of rounded or elliptical shape in Istria and Venezia Giulia, or quadrangular in Friuli, within which was the inhabited area. Some hundred Castellieri have been discovered in Istria, Friuli and Venezia Giulia, such as that of Leme, in the central-western Istria, or Elerji, near Muggia, or Monte Giove near Prosecco (Trieste) and San Polo, not far from Monfalcone. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castellieri_culture
		tradition_metal_craftsmanship # that of iron. The latter began to spread widely only with the arrival of the Carni and other Celtic populations in Friuli and Venezia Giulia. With the coming of the Celts, silver processing also received a particular impetus. The manufacturing activities had a craft character: weapons of various types were manufactured, tools for agriculture, fibulae, studs and other objects intended to accompany clothing. There was also a copious production of utensils for domestic use, often of good workmanship. https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultura_dei_castellieri
