The manufacturing activities had a craft character: weapons of various types were manufactured, tools for agriculture, fibulae, studs and other objects intended to accompany clothing. There was also a copious production of utensils for domestic use, often of good workmanship. https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultura_dei_castellieri
