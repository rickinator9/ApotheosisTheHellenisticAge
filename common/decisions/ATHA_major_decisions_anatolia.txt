# TODO: (Probably excessive, but worth considering) Character gains philhellene modifier, boosting their relationship with Greek characters as long as their culture is non-Greek (is this even possible?) - in the future it may be worth looking into whether a similar modifier could be applied to dynasties that became considerably Hellenised, though this should be invalidated for characters who adopt Greek culture. The ideal ultimately would be to have this work dynamically with any culture to reflect peer polity interaction
